                        Description:
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Lake Bumbunga is a salt lake located in South Australia near the towns of Lochiel and Bumbunga.<br>
                         Easily visible from the Highway, the lake is a dramatic departure from the surrounding landscape because of its seasonal pink coloration.
                        The Bumbunga Lake is a naturally occurring pink salt deposited lake. Imagine the amazement and disbelief when you stumble across this uniquely natural lake.<br>
                         Each summer, a large portion of the lake dries up to expose salt flats and is also replenished by seasonal rainfall and inflow of water from the surrounding hills.

                        Why Are The Lakes Pink?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        It was a complete mystery for some time, but the case has finally been cracked. <br>
                        Scientists discovered that pink bodies of water like the pink lakes in Australia, all contain a combination of Halobacteria and a species of algae known as Dunaliella salina.<br>
                         Both of which thrive in salty environments like the pink lakes. The carotenoid red pigments secreted by both substances combine with the salts and create the bright pink color. <br>
                         These same algae also flourish in the Dead Sea.
