            <summary>TRIBES</summary>
            <p>
                The term tribe is used in many different contexts to refer to a category of human social group. The
                predominant usage of the term is in the discipline of anthropology. The definition is contested, in part
                due
                to conflicting theoretical understandings of social and kinship structures, and also reflecting the
                problematic application of this concept to extremely diverse human societies. The concept is often
                contrasted by anthropologists with other social and kinship groups, being hierarchically larger than a
                lineage or clan, but smaller than a chiefdom, nation or state. These terms are equally disputed. In some
                cases tribes have legal recognition and some degree of political autonomy from national or federal
                government, but this legalistic usage of the term may conflict with anthropological definitions

                the age of space exploration.
                The Soviet Union was racing against the United States to seek advancements in their technology and be
                able
                to claim the victory title.
                The accomplishments attained by all participants marked the first steps in exploration,
                advancement in human scientific achievement,
                and a growth in the understanding of the universe.
                With each space exploration mission completed we make significant innovations and technological
                progressions
                that can be applied to many other areas other than just space.
                From the beginning of time humans have been compelled to explore newfound, unknown lands.
                The same incentives put a man on the moon as they did to bring men to explore new…

            <summary>CITIES UNDER THE WATER</summary>
            <p>
                The first "underwater city" that comes to most people's minds is probably the fictional island Plato
                alluded
                to in his works Timaeus and Critias, Atlantis — but real-life underwater cities like Alexandria, for
                example, exist too.
                Much of the ancient Egyptian city of Alexandria was severely damaged by earthquakes and a lot of its
                harbor
                area ended up beneath the sea.
                Though there are few aquatic ruins that could match the likes of Alexandria, there are many other places
                across the globe where you can find underwater cities, towns, and villages.
                The majority of them were flooded as a result of the construction of reservoirs or waterways.

            <p>
                The term deep sea creature refers to organisms that live below the photic zone of the ocean. These
                creatures
                must survive in extremely harsh conditions, such as hundreds of bars of pressure, small amounts of
                oxygen,
                very little food, no sunlight, and constant, extreme cold. Most creatures have to depend on food
                floating
                down from above.
                Common fangtooth, Anoplogaster cornuta
                These creatures live in very demanding environments, such as the abyssal or hadal zones, which, being
                thousands of meters below the surface, are almost completely devoid of light. The water is between 3 and
                10
                degrees Celsius and has low oxygen levels. Due to the depth, the pressure is between 20 and 1,000 bars.
                Creatures that live hundreds or even thousands of meters deep in the ocean have adapted to the high
                pressure, lack of light, and other factors.

            <summary>WILD ANIMAL</summary>
            <p>
                Wildlife traditionally refers to undomesticated animal species, but has come to include all organisms
                that
                grow or live wild in an area without being introduced by humans.[1] Wildlife can be found in all
                ecosystems.
                Deserts, forests, rainforests, plains, grasslands, and other areas, including the most developed urban
                areas, all have distinct forms of wildlife. While the term in popular culture usually refers to animals
                that
                are untouched by human factors, most scientists agree that much wildlife is affected by human
                activities.[2]

                Humans have historically tended to separate civilization from wildlife in a number of ways, including
                the
                legal, social, and moral senses. Some animals, however, have adapted to suburban environments. This
                includes
                such animals as domesticated cats, dogs, mice, and rats. Some religions declare certain animals to be
                sacred, and in modern times, concern for the natural environment has provoked activists to protest
                against
                the exploitation of wildlife for human benefit or entertainment.

                Global wildlife populations have decreased by 68% since 1970 as a result of human activity, particularly
                overconsumption, population growth and intensive farming, according to a 2020 World Wildlife Fund's
                Living
                Planet Report and the Zoological Society of London's Living Planet Index measure, which is further
                evidence
                that humans have unleashed a sixth mass extinction event.[3][4] According to CITES, it has been
                estimated
                that annually the international wildlife trade amounts to billions of dollars and it affects hundreds of
                millions of animal and plant specimen.[5]

                Insects are everywhere! Some people find them super interesting while others can’t even stand the
                thought of
                them. Either way, we share this planet with these alien-like creepy crawlies. Insects were here on Earth
                long before humans, and they are here to stay. There are actually way more insects than humans on Earth
                —
                there are 900,000 known species and probably millions more that haven’t even been discovered yet! Check

            <summary>ISLANDS AND VOLCANOES</summary>
            <p>
                Volcanic islands occur in ocean basins (such as the Hawaiian Islands) or on or near ocean ridges (e.g.,
                St.
                Paul Rocks and Ascension Island in the Atlantic Ocean) (Figure 1.3). They are large volcanoes erupted on
                the
                seafloor whose tops have emerged above sea level. Volcanic islands and seamounts (submerged volcanoes)
                range
                in tectonic stability from intermediate or unstable in areas where volcanism is active (like Hawaii and
                Reunion) to stable in areas of extinct volcanism (such as Easter Island). Volcanic islands range in size
                from 1 to about 104 km2. Guyots are flat-topped seamounts produced by erosion at sea level followed by
                submersion, probably due to sinking of the seafloor. Coral reefs grow on some guyots as they sink,
                producing atolls. Some of the large volcanic islands may have developed over mantle plumes, which are
                the magma sources.

                development that really helps to create a more exciting and engaging learning experience.
                However,they do lack the most important part of learning how to make the web .. actually
