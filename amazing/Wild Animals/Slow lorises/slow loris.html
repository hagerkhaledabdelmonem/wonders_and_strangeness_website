                        Description:
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Slow lorises are a group of several species of nocturnal strepsirrhine primates that make up the
                        genus Nycticebus.<br>
                        Slow lorises have a round head, a narrow snout, large eyes, and a variety of distinctive
                        coloration patterns that are species dependent.<br>
                        Their arms and legs are nearly equal in length, and their torso is long and flexible, allowing
                        them to twist and extend to nearby branches. The hands and feet of slow lorises have several
                        adaptations that give them a pincer-like grip and enable them to grasp branches for long periods
                        of time.
                        Slow lorises have a toxic bite, a trait rare among mammals and unique among the primates. The
                        toxin is obtained by licking a sweat gland on their arm, and the secretion is activated by
                        mixing with saliva.<br>
                        Their toxic bite, once thought to be primarily a deterrent to predators, has been discovered to
                        be primarily used in disputes within the species.
                        The secretion from the arm contains a chemical related to cat allergen, but may be augmented by
                        secondary toxins from the diet in wild individuals.Slow lorises move slowly and deliberately,
                        making little or no noise, and when threatened, they stop moving and remain motionless.
                        <br> Their only documented predators—apart from humans—include snakes, changeable hawk-eagles
                        and orangutans, although cats, viverrids and sun bears are suspected. Little is known about
                        their social structure, but they are known to communicate by scent marking.Males are highly
                        territorial.
                        Slow lorises reproduce slowly, and the infants are initially parked on branches or carried by
                        either parent. They are omnivores, eating small animals, fruit, tree gum, and other vegetation.
                        <br>Each of the slow loris species that had been identified prior to 2012 is listed as either
                        "Vulnerable" or "Endangered" on the IUCN Red List. The three newest species are yet to be
                        evaluated, but they arise from (and further reduce the ranks of) what was thought to be a single
                        "vulnerable" species.<br>
                        All four of these are expected to be listed with at least the same, if not a higher-risk,
                        conservation status. All slow lorises are threatened by the wildlife trade and habitat loss.
                        Their habitat is rapidly disappearing and becoming fragmented, making it nearly impossible for
                        slow lorises to disperse between forest fragments; unsustainable demand from the exotic pet
                        trade and from traditional medicine has been the greatest cause for their decline.<br>
                        Deep-rooted beliefs about the supernatural powers of slow lorises, such as their purported
                        abilities to ward off evil spirits or to cure wounds, have popularized their use in traditional
                        medicine.<br>
                        Despite local laws prohibiting trade in slow lorises and slow loris products, as well as
                        protection from international commercial trade under Appendix I, slow lorises are openly sold in
                        animal markets in Southeast Asia and smuggled to other countries, such as Japan.<br>
                        Due in part to the large eyes that are an adaptation to their nocturnal lifestyle, they have
                        also been popularized as 'cute' pets in viral videos on YouTube. Slow lorises have their teeth
                        cut or pulled out for the pet trade.<br>
                        They make poor pets as they are nocturnal, have specialized diets, are difficult to care for,
                        and often die from infection, blood loss, improper caring and handling or inadequate nutrition.

                        slow loris defense mechanism:
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        It avoids being eaten by predators. The loris has a special defense mechanism under its elbow
                        that secretes a venom from a gland. When in danger, the loris licks its skin and rubs the poison
                        to put it on its teeth. This gives it a venomous bite that will deter a predator, as it is a
                        form of protection for their babies.
                        The slow loris has such a venomous sting that it can kill a human because it thinks you can harm
                        it. Currently, there is no cure for its venom, and it is still not clear why the slow loris is
                        poisonous.
