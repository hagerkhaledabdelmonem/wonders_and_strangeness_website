                        No, unfortunately it’s not the related to the Pikachu Pokemon, but this Pika is equally as cute.
                        This mammal was actually discovered twenty years ago in China, and was not rediscovered until
                        recently. Scientists actually set up specialized cameras to track this animal. The Pika could be
                        playing the world’s best game of hide and seek! Because this furry creature is so hard to track,
                        little is known about it’s habitat and needs

                        Description:
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        A pika is a small, mountain-dwelling mammal found in Asia and North America. With short limbs,
                        very round body, an even coat of fur, and no external tail, they resemble their close relative,
                        the rabbit, but with short, rounded ears. The large-eared pika of the Himalayas and nearby
                        mountains is found at heights of more than 6,000 m (20,000 ft), among the highest of any mammal.
                        Pikas prefer rocky slopes and graze on a range of plants, mostly grasses, flowers, and young
                        stems. In the autumn, they pull hay, soft twigs, and other stores of food into their burrows to
                        eat during the long, cold winter. The pika is also known as the "whistling hare" for its
                        high-pitched alarm call when diving into its burrow.
                        The name "pika" appears to be derived from the Tungus pika and the scientific name Ochotona is
                        from the Mongolian word ogdoi, which means pika It is used for any member of the Ochotonidae, a
                        family within the order of lagomorphs which also includes the Leporidae (rabbits and hares).
                        Only one genus, Ochotona, is extant within the family, covering 37 species. Another species, the
                        Sardinian pika, belonging to the separate genus Prolagus, became extinct within the last 2000
                        years due to human activity.

                        The two species found in North America are the American pika, found primarily in the mountains
                        of the western United States and far southwestern Canada, and the collared pika of northern
                        British Columbia, the Yukon, western Northwest Territories, and Alaska.
