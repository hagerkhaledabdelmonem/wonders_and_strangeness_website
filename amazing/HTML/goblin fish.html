       <h1>Globin Fish</h1>
       <p><b>This type, apart from its strange shape, which is the reason for its name, but it also has other strange and wonderful features
        This organism, if its limbs are cut off by a predator or any other reason, can replace its limbs with other limbs exactly the same as the one it lost. This feature is also present in starfish and sea cucumbers, but what really distinguishes the sea goblin is that if it is injured, the bleeding will stop within ten seconds, i.e. External intervention, and even if he is exposed to a large wound, this wound will also heal within hours
        The sea goblin is native to Mexico and can only live up to 10 years</b></p>
