        Xi chang was the political and economic center of eastern China, and unlike most sunken cities, Xichang was not sunk by natural disasters or any kind of destructive forces.
        In 1959 AD, the Chinese government decided to set up a new hydroelectric power plant, so they built a water lake. I completely flooded the city of "Xi Chang." The historic wall and the circular wall that surrounds it, and even the houses in the city of "Xichang" still have a strong structure, and the city is considered a reservoir of ancient Chinese civilization and architectural heritage monuments of China</b></p>
