<h1>Cintirel tribe</h1>
<p><b>On the northern island of Centrale in the Indian Ocean lives the strangest tribe on Earth. The Central tribe, which is estimated to be 60,000 years old, and the tribe was able to completely hide itself from the outside world, so that the number of members of the tribe is not known yet, but the researchers put an imagination of their numbers and said that it ranges from 40 to 500 people, not more. The reason that researchers are not sure about this information is the extreme violence of the tribe, as anyone approaching the island is immediately attacked, and the tribe members live among the dense forests and this makes it more difficult to determine their life, culture and language, but all we know for sure about the Central tribe three things
    The brutality and violence of the tribe, and that they live on fishing and collecting fruits, and they do not know anything about agriculture, and despite the violence of the tribe, this did not prevent researchers and some curious people from trying to learn more information about the Central tribe, but unfortunately most of the attempts failed, including which ended in a bloody manner Among the accidents is the one that occurred in the summer of 1867 when the Indian merchant ship Nineveh was wrecked; About 86 passengers and 20 crew members arrived ashore. On the second day, the survivors said that they were subjected to a brutal attack by members of the tribe. Among the strange incidents, in 2004 the Indian government decided to send helicopters over the island. One of the most recent incidents that occurred on the island is the killing of the American citizen “John Allen Shaw” after several attempts to proselytize on the island, the last of which was in 2018, which cost his life. Some people say that the reason for the violence and brutality of the tribe members against strangers is the incident that occurred in 1880 When a British naval officer decided to take two adults and four children from the tribe and transfer them to the city of "Port Blair", but after a while the two adults died of immunodeficiency and the four returned to the island again.
