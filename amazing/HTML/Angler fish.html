       <h1>Angler fish</h1>
       <p><b>This fish is characterized by a huge body and a wide mouth, but what makes it one of the strangest marine creatures discovered is the method of reproduction
        Where the males reproduce by docking and fully merging with the body of the female and feeding from her blood, so we find the size of the female is huge compared to the size of the male, Also, the method of catching this fish for its prey is very strange, as this fish uses its large and wide mouth similar to a cave to make a trap for its prey by lying at the bottom of the ocean and burying half of its body in the sand and remaining completely still,When the fish approaches it, it suddenly opens its mouth, and the water rushes in with it quickly, and the anglerfish devours its prey</b></p>
