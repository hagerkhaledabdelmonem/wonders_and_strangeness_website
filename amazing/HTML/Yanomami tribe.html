        <h1>Yanomami tribe</h1>
        <p><b>One of the most famous tribes in the Amazon region is the Yanomami, the isolated Yanomami tribe in South America whose inhabitants live in rainforests and mountains. In northern Brazil and southern Venezuela, and like most of the tribes of the continent, it is likely that its inhabitants migrated through the Bering Strait between Asia and America about 15,000 years ago and began to split slowly making their way to South America. The population of this tribe is about 38,000 people, and the area of ​​​​the land in which it lives is in Brazil. It covers more than 90,000 km2, which is almost twice the area of ​​Switzerland. In Venezuela, it lives in an area of ​​​​80,000 km2. It is interesting that the people of the tribe live in large circular houses called the Janos or the Shabuns, which are houses that can accommodate sometimes. More than 400 residents and the central area in the center of the houses use it to hold celebrations, holidays and special rituals. The Yanomami people, like most of the Amazon peoples, are good at hunting in all ways. Its forms, but in the Yanomami tribe, the situation is a little different. The hunter for them does not eat the meat of the prey that he has hunted. But the hunters exchange prey among each other, that is, each hunter and his family eats the prey of another hunter. As for the women of the tribe, their task is to grow crops, which are equivalent to approximately 80% of the food of the whole tribe, in addition, they unanimously include nuts, oysters, larvae, insects, wild honey, and thanks to their strong knowledge of plants, they can use more than 500 plants for food, medicine and building houses</b></p>
