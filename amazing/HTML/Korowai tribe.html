        <h1>Korowai tribe</h1>
        <p><b>In 1974, one of the most primitive tribes in the world was discovered, the Korowai, which until the year 74 were completely isolated from the outside world. The Koroai people live in a forested area about 150 km from the Aravor Sea in the southeast of West Papua in the province of Papua. The population of the tribe reached 3000 people, and the tribe is so far completely independent
            Most of the inhabitants are good at hunting, produce axes from stone, make salt, and have great experience in agriculture. The first form of money that entered the tribe was through missionaries
            And if we talk about the form of life within the tribe, one of the most known things about them is that they were able to build their homes on trees, and they were quite adept at this, and the height of the houses sometimes reached more than 30 meters above the ground, that is, at the height of a ten-storey building. These houses are not just Simple houses sometimes houses divided into one, two and three rooms. One of the strangest things to know about this tribe is that they are cannibals, but what is more strange is that they do not eat cannibals for food and hunger. It's completely different for them. The cannibalism of the Korowai tribe is linked to sacred rituals, which are that they kill and eat male magicians who are called Khakhao, in addition to a second group of crimes whose punishment is that the criminal is eaten, such as theft, murder, and matters related to witchcraft, as we mentioned, and in this case the body parts of the guilty person are divided between The whole clan began to eat it. In 2006, a television team managed to film a 60-minute program there, in which it was shown that one of the Koroai community was killed. He was punished for being a khakhao or a sorcerer, and subjected to torture, execution, and finally for eating, but this custom has begun to disappear completely among the members of the tribe now.</b></p>
