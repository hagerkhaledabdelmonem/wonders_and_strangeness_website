       <h1>Heracleion City</h1>
       <p><b>It is an ancient Egyptian city that was located near the mouth of the Nile River, and this city was built on some neighboring islands in the Nile Delta and was intersected with a number of water channels, ports and marinas.
        The city's docks, temples, and houses were connected to each other by ferries and bridges, and this city was considered a commercial port and was also the main port for international trade and tax collection in the late era of ancient Egypt.
       The city also contained reserves that were used for treatment and people were sent to it from all over the world, but during the second century BC, Heraclion replaced Alexandria as the main port in Egypt. With the passage of time, the high water levels and earthquakes led to the weakness of the city of Heraclion and the facilitating the soil on which it was built.
       Its buildings collapsed in the water, and a large part of it was completely submerged, and during the period of Roman rule over Egypt, the rest of the city also sank.
       In 1999 AD, the French marine archaeologist, Franck Goddio, explored the underwater city and found the lost relics. Scientists found discoveries of pottery, coins and unfinished statues.
       The remains of the city of Heracleion are currently located in the Gulf of Abu Qir, 2.5 km from the shore and at a depth of 10 meters</b></p>
