       <h1>Frilled shark (living fossil)</h1>
       <p><b>It is called a living fossil because of its strange shape that has not changed for hundreds of years. The fish has 6 pairs of slits around the neck that give it its frilled appearance
        The frilled shark has a cylindrical body, up to two meters long
        Its cartilaginous skeleton and massive liver full of low-density fat allow it to float in the deepest regions of water and oceans.
        The frilled shark spends most of its time in deep and dark waters in the open waters of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and lives to depths of up to 1200 meters.
        This shark has 300 teeth distributed over 25 rows of hook teeth
        Because of its wide jaw, it can swallow prey up to half its length. Its main food is squid, but it feeds on other fish as well, even various sharks.</b></p>
