       <h1>Mimic octopus (The King of disguise and the ocean wizard)</h1>
       <p><b>In the year one thousand nine hundred and 98 on the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia. Mimic octopus discovered
        The mimic octopus lives in shallow sandy depths near estuaries and is known for its abundance of predators.
        Most octopuses when exposed to attack follow a method that makes them less visible, such as disappearing between rocks or in pits, but the imitative octopus does not recognize the axioms, but rather follows the principle of attack is the best means of defense. It makes it look like the chosen animal and not only imitates its color or shape, but it also imitates the way it moves and imitates its personality, for example, in order to be able to move freely away from the depths, it disguises itself in the form of a lion fish known as the dragon fish. The mimic octopus changes the shape of its arms to appear like thorns after it changes its color to the color of the white fish in brown, and it mimics its swimming style.</b></p>

       <p><b>The matter does not stop at this fish only, it also imitates the dimple fish, which is known to be one of the small fish preyed upon by the sea snake. Which happens to be one of the octopus predators, despite its small size, but it is very poisonous. The six leaves only two outstretched arms opposite each other on the sand and begins to squirm like a sea eel after changing its color. And the black color in the white that is famous for the eel, and thus the damsel fish, moves away from it</b></p>

       <br>
       <p><b>We also find the octopus disguised as a flat fish, changing its color to a color close to the color of sand and starting to imitate its way of swimming quickly and very close to the ocean floor. He returns all his arms back and compresses them so that it becomes the flat shape of the fish's body and fins
        These were three marine creatures out of 15 creatures that an octopus can disguise itself as. It takes their form quickly and smoothly and disguises not only their outward appearance but also their character and movement composition.</b></p>
