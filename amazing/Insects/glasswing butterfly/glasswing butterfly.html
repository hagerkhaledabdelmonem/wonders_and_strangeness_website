                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Greta oto is a species of brush-footed butterfly and member of the subfamily Danainae, tribe
                        Ithomiini, and subtribe Godyridina. <br>
                        It is known by the common name glasswing butterfly for its transparent wings, which allow it to
                        camouflage without extensive coloration. In Spanish speaking regions, it may also be referred to
                        as espejitos, meaning "little mirrors" because of its transparent wings.<br>
                        The butterfly is mainly found in Central and northern regions of South America with sightings as
                        far north as Texas and as far south as Chile. While its wings appear delicate, the butterfly is
                        able to carry up to 40 times its own weight.<br>
                        In addition to its wing physiology, the butterfly is known for behaviors such as long migrations
                        and lekking. The Greta oto closely resembles the Greta andromica.

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The glasswing butterfly is most commonly found from Central to South America as far south as
                        Chile, with appearances as north as Mexico and Texas.<br>
                        This butterfly thrives in the tropical conditions of the rainforests in the Central and South
                        American countries.
