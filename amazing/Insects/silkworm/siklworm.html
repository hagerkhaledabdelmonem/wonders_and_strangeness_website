            Bombyx mori, the domestic silk moth, is an insect from the moth family Bombycidae. It is the closest
            relative of Bombyx mandarina, the wild silk moth.<br>
            The silkworm is the larva or caterpillar of a silk moth. It is an economically important insect, being a
            primary producer of silk. A silkworm's preferred food are white mulberry leaves, though they may eat other
            mulberry species and even the osage orange.<br>
            Domestic silk moths are entirely dependent on humans for reproduction, as a result of millennia of selective
            breeding. Wild silk moths (other species of Bombyx) are not as commercially viable in the production of
            silk.<br>
            Sericulture, the practice of breeding silkworms for the production of raw silk, has been under way for at
            least 5,000 years in China, whence it spread to India, Korea, Nepal, Japan, and the West.<br>
            The domestic silk moth was domesticated from the wild silk moth Bombyx mandarina, which has a range from
            northern India to northern China, Korea, Japan, and the far eastern regions of Russia. <br>
            The domestic silk moth derives from Chinese rather than Japanese or Korean stock.Silk moths were unlikely to
            have been domestically bred before the Neolithic Age.<br>
            Before then, the tools to manufacture quantities of silk thread had not been developed. The domesticated
            B.mori and the wild B.mandarina can still breed and sometimes produce hybrids.<br>
            Domestic silk moths are very different from most members in the genus Bombyx; not only have they lost the
            ability to fly, but their color pigments have also been lost.
